Today was Martir Luther King Jr, so it was a national holiday. Still, many of us came to RC to keep going. I decided to walk here for the first time, it's only around 10km away, and this really helped understand what was going on *above ground*. 

I met with roberto, and after shwing to him the referrer vulnerability project, I decided to polish and finish it.
It is now online on [mi site](http://safesite.ondoheer.com). Style wise I just cloned/copied Athelas design for it's 404 page. Thanks Heison for the RocketShip!

Then I decided to dig into week 2 of nand2tetris, I learned what an ALU is (arithmetic logic unit) and how I could build the parts required for it using the chips I had already build during week 1. It was amazing actually. The clevernes whith which it was implemented is just out of this world. Binary mathematics seems like magic sometimes, I reckon this is what math feels like for people that don't know much about it.

I managed to finish all the parts required, and build the basis for my ALU, but I couldn't get it to past the more complex tests. I'll meet with Jarred tomorrow so he can walk me through his implementation.
