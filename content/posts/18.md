title: "Day 18: Golang, Algos and I need to sleep!"

I stayed up late reading all about Golang frameworks, their patterns, how they recommend to work, and what it’s good for. Most people didin’t recommend it for fast changing projects, and it’s strength is on concurrency, so for small MPV’s it makes no sense. Still I feel it’s really opening my mind to diferent programming paradigms, so I’ll finish building the small redo of my expense tracker app with go and react.

I’ll try to pack it with reactNative.

Katie asked on the algo group if someone wanted to pair on this weeks psets, and I offered volunteer. It was great, none of us has a CS background and we struggled to really understand what the basic algorithm was doing, but we managed to understand it in and out. After the lack of sleep, this experience took all of my remaining energies and I just tumbled around different projects for the rest of the day. I need to sleep!!!
