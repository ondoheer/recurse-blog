Today I started by watching the Algorithms class for week 2. I was so hooked on React (and coding mostly) that I wasn't to keen on watching it. I was wrong, the class is enticing and teaches complex concepts in a really great way. After that I was able to understand the afternoon algo's meeting on rendering fractals with the CPU or the GPU asypthotic complexity. I have set myself a goal of spending 1 hour at these meetings so I don't get distracted from nadn2tetris and the ReactJS book, this time I'm going to finish it.

So, after the 1630 meditation group I continued with ReactJS refactoring the code and learning about data hierarchy (now it is clear why this can easily run out of control and something like the Flux pattern will be needed).

Started week 3 on nand2tetris on combinatorial logic. Now I understand the tight bond between electrical currents and the CPU clock tick. tomorrow I will learn about RAM and probably will have to "build" some RAM chips as homework.
