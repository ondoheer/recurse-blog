So, today I arrived at RC at 820, I was surprised to be the first, so I poured myself some coffee and started working on the HDL Chip Design excercises.
I had to go back to the NAND descripcion videos and pick up some pen and paper to actually understand how electronic circuits work.
After some pen and paper hacking I manage to compose the basic circuits, then, reviewing implementations, and reviewing the book again, I end up with valid Mux and Demux chips. This is like puzzle solving!

I sat with James to see what he was doing, it was so ming blowing, working with programable languages to create a javascript language that could *unserstand* natural language. Had a lod of fun seeing what it could do. There is much more to this, but I feel that it would require a whole post. The most important part for me was, how in the middle of our conversation, I started to propose solutions that in other contexts would have been unthinkable. Not only are the people here capable of anything, the ambience promotes to think like that. No more clients with small budgets, or deadlines established by PM's with no knowledge of their products. I really enjoyed feeling like that.

At this point, **Bryan** shows his RC blog on Zulip and I decide to follow his steps. he tells me he built it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). I had read about it's power but thought it might be a wrong suit for me because it was written in Go. I was mistaken. Hugo is just perfect, everything is abstracted in such a way that you don't need to touch the Go parts of it. This blog was build and deployed in under 30 mins!!

By mid day I get together with **Ann**, she has started a Flask project to recreate her Blog with it so she can explore backend. Without realizing it, she has actually started creating a static site generator. I really like the way she tackles problems, she has a knack for this! She has already realized that JSON is a crappy format to writte her blog posts nd portfolio articles in, so I suggest Md, YAML or TOML, and give her a few tips on how to continue learning Flask by herself. It's nice to take the rust out of my Flask skills!

At 1600 we had a pair programming workshop. Ayla gave a great presentation on it's history and best practices. After that I got together with Levi to practice they way we were instructed. I chose an [excercise](http://exercism.io/exercises/python/secret-handshake/readme) from **excercism.io** and our goal was to ref\*cktor it. I had a hard time at first trying to solve the problem, it had to do with binary conversions, and I never really studied bitwise operators. Most of Levi solutions went that way, so he had to dumb down to my level first for us to be able to solve it! After that we had to make work in the least efficent posible, and in the 20 minutes we had lef, we managed to do [this](https://repl.it/repls/CriticalExcitableCockerspaniel)
