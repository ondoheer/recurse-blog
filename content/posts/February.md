So, [Here it goes again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTAAsCNK7RA). First I stopped publishing, then I took my whole server down. The story has many parts, but the importante parts:

1. I finished the Go backend and decided not to use it. Go is amazing, but if I am not going to be using it regularly, it makes no sense to mantain an app in a language I will abrely use. 
2. I rebuild it all from scratch using Flask
3. Then I decided to build the frontend in ReactJS, and it was great (more coming soon)
4. I took part the Hack The Deep AMNH hackaton and we won! (more coming soon)
5. I was so focused on coding that I didin't continue nand2tetris, I have to finish the first half this week
6. A new batch has arrived
7. My parents came to town

I will generate new posts for the important items on the previous weeks I don't want to forget about.
