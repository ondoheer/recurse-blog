Yesterday after presenting Spendy I started to work on it's PWA side. I fixed some minor bugs, and then researched a bit about different PWA implementations. 
To be truly able to deploy I need for them to work on production on a secure server, so I will have to try the let's encrypt nginx-helper docker image first. If that fails, I'll end up using cloudflare as the main server and take advantage of their SSL cert.

Also, Erin proposed we do [JS 30](https://javascript30.com/) which I definetly want to work on. So starting monday we will go for this.
