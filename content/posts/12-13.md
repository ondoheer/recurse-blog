On saturday I decided to stay home until I had fully understood Redux and the flux pattern. I did the online course by the Redux creator, where he tought how to build Redux from scratch and use it.
It was enlighting, but when I tried to apply it to my kanban project, I realized I really had no real hands experience with React and I was skipping steps. So I rewinded and started React on Treehouse for I knew they would have nice basic projects to complete. I forced myself to do before watching the videos, and it gave me a better understanding of it. 

On sunday I continued and actually began working with React Router v4. I wanted to get everything finished before monday so I could continue to work on nand2tetris and the Algos course during the week. So little time!
