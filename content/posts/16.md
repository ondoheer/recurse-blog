I stayed at home to wait for the Fedex delivery, and now it says it might come at any time from 12-20… I’ll try to make the best out of this day. I finished my basic version of the Dice Roller App, and now I will go through the Redux tutorials to see if I can refactor my code to use it.

By the end of the day I had to things clear: 1. It was harder than I thought to skate to RC. I managed to get almost there and then turned around, I was just test driving the skates and didin’t have my laptop nor extra shoes in case I couldn’t make it back. 2. I am finally getting Redux :D


### Snippets

* I will start to skate around Prospect Park.
* I cannot work at home
