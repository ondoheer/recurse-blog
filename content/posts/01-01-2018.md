I almost arrive late (or don't arrive at all) to my first day.
My flight from panama got turned around because of an accident due to bad weather at JFk airport. Luckyly in the end we embarqued in a charter direct to NYC.

As I was knackered by the 2 day trip and had barely slept, I'll just bulletpoint what I remember:

* RC tour, didin't really hear what Nick was saying, will figure it out on the way
* Another peruvian in the same batch!! Great news, he is great.
* Tried my best to remeber other peoples names, as always, didin't work.
* Learned about Natural Language Vectors from another RCer, went for lunch with him and downloaded his brother's just released game **Antihero**
* I don't have my laptop yet, so after struggling with staying awake in the afternoon, I decided to go pick it up and visit Augusto
* **Nadn2Tetris!** I heard about it at the RC email presentations, I read about it in HN, but somehow just listening to people talk about it convinced me. I wanted to learn the fundamentals of CS, so what better way than this? I might start tomorrow!
