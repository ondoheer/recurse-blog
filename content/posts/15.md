I arrived really early to make the most out of the day. I started by watching week 3 of the Algo’s course, and then spend the morning doing the nand2tetris assembly psets. It was fun, I coundl’t handle working as an assembly coder, but doing it just for fun was amazing. It reminded me of the logic problems, which seemed more like a puzzle than homework.

Ann brought her old Google Glass set today. It was interesting to play with. I was nothing like the advertising video, which seemed more like Augmented Reality than what it is, a simple projection on the glasses. I could only think of really technical uses for it, and maybe, as Ann said, to cycle or skate and use Gmaps at the same time.

In the afternoon I decided to build a Dice Roller React App from scratch so that I could really get a hold of it, and to later migrate to the Redux architecture, and who knows, maybe to React Native? I am finally learning some of the intricancies of the system, and James is really helping me with it.

### Snippets

* Fedex attempted to deliver my skates today, no one was home, so I will have to stay home tomorrow to receive them.
* Landed an interview with Trello for Vía Código, this is great news!
* [Autism Glass Project](http://autismglass.stanford.edu/), haven’t read much yet, but seems interesting to read more about.
