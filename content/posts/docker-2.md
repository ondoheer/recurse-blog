So, I fixed the CORS issue, and as I suspected, it wasn't a CORS issue per se. It was really frustrating, because it meant there was something I wasn't getting right. 
Laurent came to help me (again) and we could not finish tackling the problem because I had a patient call. It was kind of frustrating, I wanted to move on and keep on learning new stuff!
Oh, and my Skype account got Hacked as I was having my session! Serves me good for not changing that password.
After my session and lunch, I wen't to Babbage to vent out a little (There is always nice people there to vent out with).
At 5 I decided to try figure out what was going on with my Docker config, Roberto came by and as I was explaining to him what was going on, I spotted the problem! And I literally mean spotted, it was a Typo! A bloody lovely typo. I had ```api.spendi.local``` instead of ```api.spendy.local``` as my domain name. This was so good. It meant I was just clumsy and my understanding of Docker was correct.

Now with everything working the way it should, I have set the workpath for the next two weeks

1. Style Responsive styles
2. Try to debug basic stuff
3. Docker-machine to deploy the app
4. PWA the shit out of it
5. Learn about PWA push notifications 

### Snippets
