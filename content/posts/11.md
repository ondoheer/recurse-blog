Today I spent most of the day practicing with React. The book had become a little outdated and was starting to work on Animations. I called James to talk about it, and see if it was a good use of my time to actually do it like that. 
He did not only say it was rubish, but also gave me an amazing 2h talk on React, funtional principles and components composition for stateless systems. I ended up so excited I decided to learn redux over the weekend.

At 3 pm we had our first NLP with python meeting, James, Anna and Laurent joined as well and we began by scraping a bunch of New York times articles to analyse.
It turned out none of us was really good with BeautifulSoup so we ended up the meeting without having fully extracted pure textx of all the html articles.
We will focus on finishing this on monday.

Since RC was closing early today due to some maintenance issues, we left for drinks with a bunch of people.


### Snippets

* Never got to the stores I planned to because we stayed at the pub until really late.
