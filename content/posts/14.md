I started by finishing the React Router tutorial, and then forced myself to stop coding (really hard) to watch the next week of nand2tetris. It stared by explaining the hack programming language and it's interface. It was interesting, it is simmilar to what I had seen of Assembly language, but the really cool part came when I started learning about how writting pixels to a screen works. First, it is so basic anyone can figure it out, but once you start seeing how it goes into the CPU architecture and how it starts loading the instructions per clock cycle, I realized what is it that is happening when a program that consumes a lot of memory (ussually bugged) freezes the PC screen. 
I love it!

This weeks lecture was really long, they explained the Hack programing language which I will use to write the assembly code for the Hack computer.
Tomorrow I'll try to start writting ASM :-\\

The NLP group got together and after a few hours we finally managed to start playing with Spacy. We managed now to extract the PERSON entities from the texts and to organize them by sentences. 

We probabbly require a counter to actually see how many times each person appears in the text.

### Snippets

* Victor is discovering Flask, amazing!
