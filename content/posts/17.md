Today I finished refactoring my DiceRoller app to Redux. It worked! James helped me grasp the subtleties ob how I should dispatch the events, and the pattern is actually exciting! I still need a lot more practice, I’m thinking about creating a PWA for the cthulu RPG based on karels design.

I started learning Golang today by following their tutorial on webservers. I managed to create a simple webapp and failed when I tried to create composable templates, but I’m sure I’ll have it figured out by tomorrow.
