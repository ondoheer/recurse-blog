title: "Pan con chicharron, Uma Thurman y SSL"

I stated the week by doing Wess Boss JS30 excercises, they are quick, precise and powerful

Today I spent the whole day figuring out how to deploy my Spendy production system using Docker.gen to autodiscover virtual hosts so another container (let's encrypt helper) would start issuing SSL certificates for the domains.

I have to tweak a few more things, for example, everything is broken now :P


### Snippets

* I prepared pan con chicharron today for friends at RC, we managed to get all the right ingredients!
* I am going to watch *The Pasisian Woman* with Augusto today, produced by the House of Cards show producers and with Uma Thurman in the main role (maybe as a parisian woman?? We will see)
* Packhacker is going great, I just have to tweak some more stuff on the weekend
* Had a long and good conversation with Sylvia during the weekend *wink* *wink*
* Had a meeting with Zach to talk about career oportunities here, really helped me get some perspective
* Finally went to Atoradero to meet with Evelyn, was so full of the brunch I did not eat, but it seems really good
