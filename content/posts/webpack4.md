title: "Webpack4 with hot reloading"

Yesterday I finished setting up my Docker system to handle the automatic SSL system with Let's Encrypt. After that I wanted to get back to programming, and Parcel was getting on the way. It did too much magic for my taste, and Webpack 4 was just released, apparently with a similar mindset.

It is a LIE, the automatic config only works for the most basic cases, and if that is what you are looking for, then I recommed you use Parcel.

After 3h and two pairing sessions with James to think what we might require or not I managed to set up everything working with Webpack 4, specially the Hot Module Reload Plugin. I still have to be able to use Uglify JS with webpack 4 , but the issues on the repo seem to be unsolved. I won't loose any more time with it and will focus on programming.

 


### Snippets

* The parisian woman wasn't good, Una Thurman was good though
* The Harry Potter play tickets are too expensive :_(
* I have a meeting with another potential client today, it's a prestashop website so I am not sure about it
* I am so tired, I need a day off!
* Manifest Destiny is too good (comic) I have to think if I will buy it or not, it might mean I have to leave more stuff back here
