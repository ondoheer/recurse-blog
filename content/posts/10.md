Today I signed up to give the **target="\_blank"** vulnerability talk. It was at 1745, so I had plenty of time to focus on other stuff.
I started vbvy building the RAM chips for the Nand2Tetris class, and then decided to further advance on the ReactJS book. I programmed at least until 1720 and then went out to socialize before the talk. The ReactJS book is becoming the sort of book where you actually think there have to be other ways of doing this. I asked James, and tomorrow he will show me some nice patterns to deal with React.

The talk went great, I forgot to mention the mitigation techniques in depth, and how some Cross-Origin request headers can block the referrer data, but they will find out anyway ;-) .

Ann posted a plan to work on Natural Language Processing with Python, so I jumped into that as well. I'm only worried it will get in the way of other stuff.

There was another talk at 1930, so we had pizzas to wait for it (RC is a great host) but I decided not to stay for the talk and have a break.
