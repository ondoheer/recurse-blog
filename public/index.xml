      <description>Today I started with Nand2Tetris, it is this amazing course from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where they teach you from scratch how to buld an actual computer. We begin by learning how to build basic logical gates or computer chips with a Hardware Design Language, and from there, you begin your travel to higher and higher abstractions. The actual path is:
 Boolean Logic Boolean Arithmetic Sequential Logic Machine Language Computer Architecture Assembler Virtual Machine: Stack Arithmetic Virtual Machine: Program Control High Level Language Compiler: Syntax Analysis Compiler: Code Generation Operating System Postscript  So basically you begin building basic CPU chips using only NAND gates and end up with a fully fledged computer capable of runing not only the OS that you built, but also any software you right and compile for it.</description>

      <description>I almost arrive late (or don&amp;rsquo;t arrive at all) to my first day. My flight from panama got turned around because of an accident due to bad weather at JFk airport. Luckyly in the end we embarqued in a charter direct to NYC.
As I was knackered by the 2 day trip and had barely slept, I&amp;rsquo;ll just bulletpoint what I remember:
 RC tour, didin&amp;rsquo;t really hear what Nick was saying, will figure it out on the way Another peruvian in the same batch!</description>
