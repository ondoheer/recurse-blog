						<div class="post-summary"><p>Yesterday I finished setting up my Docker system to handle the automatic SSL system with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt. After that I wanted to get back to programming, and Parcel was getting on the way. It did too much magic for my taste, and Webpack 4 was just released, apparently with a similar mindset.
It is a LIE, the automatic config only works for the most basic cases, and if that is what you are looking for, then I recommed you use Parcel.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I stated the week by doing Wess Boss JS30 excercises, they are quick, precise and powerful
Today I spent the whole day figuring out how to deploy my Spendy production system using Docker.gen to autodiscover virtual hosts so another container (let&rsquo;s encrypt helper) would start issuing SSL certificates for the domains.
I have to tweak a few more things, for example, everything is broken now :P
Snippets  I prepared pan con chicharron today for friends at RC, we managed to get all the right ingredients!</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Yesterday after presenting Spendy I started to work on it&rsquo;s PWA side. I fixed some minor bugs, and then researched a bit about different PWA implementations. To be truly able to deploy I need for them to work on production on a secure server, so I will have to try the let&rsquo;s encrypt nginx-helper docker image first. If that fails, I&rsquo;ll end up using cloudflare as the main server and take advantage of their SSL cert.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Yesterday I started the day by adjusting my css code to work decently on all devices. I felt I couldn&rsquo;t start looking into deployment until this was ready. Thanks to Mart√≠n el Coach and his great media queries mixins, this took only about 2 hours. This was supposed to be my task for the day, so I started solving minor issues. At lunch we wen&rsquo;t for some cheap chinese and a stroll at the park (James, Lily, Ana and me), then I went to book my Yoga classes.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Feb 28, 2018</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Yesterday James and I decided to test parcel as React/Redux project bundler. At first it seemed magical, we just removed Webpack and everything just worked, we could even import the root scss file directly into our index.html and it would take care of everything. So much magic came at a cost we are still assesing though.
 If you import an empty scss file, it breaks If you import the same file (js or scss/css) from your html and your main .</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>So, I fixed the CORS issue, and as I suspected, it wasn&rsquo;t a CORS issue per se. It was really frustrating, because it meant there was something I wasn&rsquo;t getting right. Laurent came to help me (again) and we could not finish tackling the problem because I had a patient call. It was kind of frustrating, I wanted to move on and keep on learning new stuff! Oh, and my Skype account got Hacked as I was having my session!</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Last week I decided to finally tackle Docker. As always, I set myself the goal to be done with it at most by friday night. I maged to, on friday at 11pm at my house, but it was hard as hell.
I have a bit of DevOps experience, I mostly know how to configure linux servers by hand, and have used tools such as Pythons Fabric library, I have even played or worked on allready built Docker projects, but I felt I needed to understand it more, and see how to deploy more complex projects.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Today is thursday and I feel I have spend the whole week just debugging stuff. The nice part, is everything works now, and I felt no rush to be done quick because I had to go to work at my practice or the client&rsquo;s budget had alreasdy run out and we were losing money. This was really good. It made me value what having time to really get to understand a problem does for the project.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>DISCLAIMER: it seems the website theme doesn&rsquo;t recognize the images direction and just shows them all in landscape, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll fix this
From february 9 to 11 I joined some recursers at the Hack the Deep Hackaton. It was amazing.
Different to other Hackatons, it wasn&rsquo;t an open project one. The American Museum of Natural History had worked with some of their scientists to come up with challenges they needed technical skills to solve.</p></div>
