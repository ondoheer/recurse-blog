						<div class="post-summary"><p>So, I fixed the CORS issue, and as I suspected, it wasn&rsquo;t a CORS issue per se. It was really frustrating, because it meant there was something I wasn&rsquo;t getting right. Laurent came to help me (again) and we could not finish tackling the problem because I had a patient call. It was kind of frustrating, I wanted to move on and keep on learning new stuff! Oh, and my Skype account got Hacked as I was having my session!</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Feb 27, 2018</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Yesterday James and I decided to test parcel as React/Redux project bundler. At first it seemed magical, we just removed Webpack and everything just worked, we could even import the root scss file directly into our index.html and it would take care of everything. So much magic came at a cost we are still assesing though.
 If you import an empty scss file, it breaks If you import the same file (js or scss/css) from your html and your main .</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Last week I decided to finally tackle Docker. As always, I set myself the goal to be done with it at most by friday night. I maged to, on friday at 11pm at my house, but it was hard as hell.
I have a bit of DevOps experience, I mostly know how to configure linux servers by hand, and have used tools such as Pythons Fabric library, I have even played or worked on allready built Docker projects, but I felt I needed to understand it more, and see how to deploy more complex projects.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Today is thursday and I feel I have spend the whole week just debugging stuff. The nice part, is everything works now, and I felt no rush to be done quick because I had to go to work at my practice or the client&rsquo;s budget had alreasdy run out and we were losing money. This was really good. It made me value what having time to really get to understand a problem does for the project.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>DISCLAIMER: it seems the website theme doesn&rsquo;t recognize the images direction and just shows them all in landscape, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll fix this
From february 9 to 11 I joined some recursers at the Hack the Deep Hackaton. It was amazing.
Different to other Hackatons, it wasn&rsquo;t an open project one. The American Museum of Natural History had worked with some of their scientists to come up with challenges they needed technical skills to solve.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>So, Here it goes again. First I stopped publishing, then I took my whole server down. The story has many parts, but the importante parts:
 I finished the Go backend and decided not to use it. Go is amazing, but if I am not going to be using it regularly, it makes no sense to mantain an app in a language I will abrely use. I rebuild it all from scratch using Flask Then I decided to build the frontend in ReactJS, and it was great (more coming soon) I took part the Hack The Deep AMNH hackaton and we won!</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Jan 26, 2018</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>I stayed up late reading all about Golang frameworks, their patterns, how they recommend to work, and what it’s good for. Most people didin’t recommend it for fast changing projects, and it’s strength is on concurrency, so for small MPV’s it makes no sense. Still I feel it’s really opening my mind to diferent programming paradigms, so I’ll finish building the small redo of my expense tracker app with go and react.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Jan 25, 2018</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Today I finished refactoring my DiceRoller app to Redux. It worked! James helped me grasp the subtleties ob how I should dispatch the events, and the pattern is actually exciting! I still need a lot more practice, I’m thinking about creating a PWA for the cthulu RPG based on karels design.
I started learning Golang today by following their tutorial on webservers. I managed to create a simple webapp and failed when I tried to create composable templates, but I’m sure I’ll have it figured out by tomorrow.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>I stayed at home to wait for the Fedex delivery, and now it says it might come at any time from 12-20… I’ll try to make the best out of this day. I finished my basic version of the Dice Roller App, and now I will go through the Redux tutorials to see if I can refactor my code to use it.
By the end of the day I had to things clear: 1.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Jan 23, 2018</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>I arrived really early to make the most out of the day. I started by watching week 3 of the Algo’s course, and then spend the morning doing the nand2tetris assembly psets. It was fun, I coundl’t handle working as an assembly coder, but doing it just for fun was amazing. It reminded me of the logic problems, which seemed more like a puzzle than homework.
Ann brought her old Google Glass set today.</p></div>
