<p>So, I fixed the CORS issue, and as I suspected, it wasn&rsquo;t a CORS issue per se. It was really frustrating, because it meant there was something I wasn&rsquo;t getting right.
Laurent came to help me (again) and we could not finish tackling the problem because I had a patient call. It was kind of frustrating, I wanted to move on and keep on learning new stuff!
Oh, and my Skype account got Hacked as I was having my session! Serves me good for not changing that password.
After my session and lunch, I wen&rsquo;t to Babbage to vent out a little (There is always nice people there to vent out with).
At 5 I decided to try figure out what was going on with my Docker config, Roberto came by and as I was explaining to him what was going on, I spotted the problem! And I literally mean spotted, it was a Typo! A bloody lovely typo. I had <code>api.spendi.local</code> instead of <code>api.spendy.local</code> as my domain name. This was so good. It meant I was just clumsy and my understanding of Docker was correct.</p>

<p>Now with everything working the way it should, I have set the workpath for the next two weeks</p>

<ol>
<li>Style Responsive styles</li>
<li>Try to debug basic stuff</li>
<li>Docker-machine to deploy the app</li>
<li>PWA the shit out of it</li>
<li>Learn about PWA push notifications</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="snippets">Snippets</h3>

<ul>
<li>Wen&rsquo;t to a gig with Eric and Cole, the music was really good (raw rock and roll). It was a band from Philly (Cole is from there).</li>
<li>Skype account got hacked because I did not change a vulnerable password</li>
<li>Sonali is connecting me with people that might help me foind out more about a managing career</li>
</ul>
