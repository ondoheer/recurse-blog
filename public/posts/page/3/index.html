						<div class="post-summary"><p>Yesterday I played Overwatch until 1 am, I will blame Renato, everything it&rsquo;s always his fault. I thought this woudl not be a productive day, but I have to say, Esen is right when he says he codes better when he is a little bit tired, this way the brain focuses only at the task at hand and doesn&rsquo;t wander around so much. I arrived and met James, toyed a bit with my phishing site and couldn&rsquo;t find a single famous site that hadn&rsquo;t prevented the attack yet.</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Today was Martir Luther King Jr, so it was a national holiday. Still, many of us came to RC to keep going. I decided to walk here for the first time, it&rsquo;s only around 10km away, and this really helped understand what was going on above ground.
I met with roberto, and after shwing to him the referrer vulnerability project, I decided to polish and finish it. It is now online on mi site.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>So, today was sunday, but we could still come to RC, it&rsquo;s open 24x7! I decided I wanted to try to implement a website idea I had a while ago while documenting on the referrer browser functionality. The referrer functionality allows a website that was opened with a target=&rdquo;_blank&rdquo; attribute, to take control of the original website location context, so it could change the previous website while you are not looking.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Today I arrived and met Alessandro, he is from the mini batch, so this is his last day. From him I learned about some amazing initiatives being developed like TablaViva. He is working in creating a reactive environment that will react to defined facts. I find itr fascinating because I think this could really end up being a great tool to teach kids about logic and how computers work. Initiatives like Cubetto are nice, but their goal is to be used inside of your house.</p></div>

						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Today I forgot my laptop and realized only too late, so by the time I got back to RC with it, it was already 1230. I started by finishing the Chips excercises. I thought the 16 bit ones were going to be more challenging, but they were just what they are meant to be, 16 bit chips (duh), so here is a 16 bit implementation of the AND chip</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Jan 10, 2018</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>So, today I arrived at RC at 820, I was surprised to be the first, so I poured myself some coffee and started working on the HDL Chip Design excercises. I had to go back to the NAND descripcion videos and pick up some pen and paper to actually understand how electronic circuits work. After some pen and paper hacking I manage to compose the basic circuits, then, reviewing implementations, and reviewing the book again, I end up with valid Mux and Demux chips.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Jan 9, 2018</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>Today I started with Nand2Tetris, it is this amazing course from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where they teach you from scratch how to buld an actual computer. We begin by learning how to build basic logical gates or computer chips with a Hardware Design Language, and from there, you begin your travel to higher and higher abstractions. The actual path is:
 Boolean Logic Boolean Arithmetic Sequential Logic Machine Language Computer Architecture Assembler Virtual Machine: Stack Arithmetic Virtual Machine: Program Control High Level Language Compiler: Syntax Analysis Compiler: Code Generation Operating System Postscript  So basically you begin building basic CPU chips using only NAND gates and end up with a fully fledged computer capable of runing not only the OS that you built, but also any software you right and compile for it.</p></div>

							<h4 class="post-date">Jan 8, 2018</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="post-summary"><p>I almost arrive late (or don&rsquo;t arrive at all) to my first day. My flight from panama got turned around because of an accident due to bad weather at JFk airport. Luckyly in the end we embarqued in a charter direct to NYC.
As I was knackered by the 2 day trip and had barely slept, I&rsquo;ll just bulletpoint what I remember:
 RC tour, didin&rsquo;t really hear what Nick was saying, will figure it out on the way Another peruvian in the same batch!</p></div>
